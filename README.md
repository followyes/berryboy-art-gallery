# Berryboy Art Gallery — Stage 12C65E

## Mobile Asset Streaming / Memory Budget

Stage 12C65E is one complete production stage built on Stage 12C65D. It replaces the previous post-entry "load everything" behavior with a zone-aware runtime:

- **critical** — the current gallery zone; required previews and sculptures are prepared before Interaction Ready,
- **nearby** — adjacent zones; loaded after entry with lower priority,
- **deferred** — distant zones; left unloaded until the camera approaches.

The global collision shell (walls, floor and ceiling) remains startup-critical so navigation and Local Light targeting do not operate on incomplete architecture. Props remain optional and begin after Interaction Ready.

## Included systems

- zones derived from floor bounds, with grid fallback for large segmented floors,
- prioritized artwork and sculpture queues,
- current-zone full-resolution artwork upgrades,
- mobile texture and model resident budgets,
- disposal and re-queue of distant artwork textures and sculpture models,
- explicit KTX2 artwork variants with JPG/WebP fallback,
- support for KTX2 textures embedded in GLB,
- optional low-LOD sculpture URL for nearby zones and high-detail URL for the critical zone,
- distance culling LOD for loaded sculpture and Props meshes,
- mobile AssetContainer cache bypass so unloaded models can actually release GPU resources,
- current + adjacent zone activation for Props and Local Lights,
- streaming budgets updated when Adaptive Quality changes,
- debug API at `window.BerryboyArtGalleryStreaming`.

## Optional state fields

Artwork image state can include:

- `imageUrlKtx2Preview` / `ktx2PreviewUrl`
- `imageUrlKtx2Mobile` / `ktx2MobileUrl`
- `imageUrlKtx2Web` / `ktx2WebUrl`
- `imageUrlKtx2` / `ktx2Url`

Sculpture model state can include:

- `lodUrl` (aliases accepted during normalization: `modelUrlLow`, `lowUrl`)
- `lodCullDistance`

Existing JPG/WebP artwork URLs and original GLB URLs remain valid fallbacks. Stage 12C65E does not fabricate converted KTX2 or low-poly assets; the runtime consumes these variants when they exist in Storage/state.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
npm run check
```

This checks JavaScript syntax, Stage identity, queue contracts, KTX2 fallback, model LOD, memory release, zone-based Local Lights, the login ON/OFF contract, minified output and protected Inspect functions.


## Edit Mode Pointer Fix

During Previous/Next camera transitions the buttons are now temporarily disabled without being removed from layout. The mobile navigation row keeps a fixed height, so the popup safe-frame and camera composition no longer jump.


## Edit Mode Pointer Fix
The floating Edit Mode button now explicitly restores pointer hit testing inside the click-through HUD controls layer. The engine import cache key was refreshed.
