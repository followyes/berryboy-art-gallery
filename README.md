# Exhibition Platform

Current repository release: **C6C8C25.3 — Exhibition Publish / Optional Cover**.

This repository contains the deployable Babylon.js 3D Exhibition Platform plus repository-local build and regression tooling. Database migration/deployment SQL is intentionally kept outside `REPO` in the documented release package.

## Product model

- **Venue / Gallery** is the reusable physical 3D environment.
- **Venue Version** is an immutable published/history version of that environment and its runtime manifest/assets.
- **Space** is the runtime representation of the resolved Venue Version passed into Babylon.
- **Exhibition** is the content/publication layer shown inside a Gallery.
- An Exhibition has independent Draft, Published and Previous state/card/ exact Venue Version channels.
- `exhibitions.venue_id` / `exhibition_states.venue_id` describe the current **Draft authoring Gallery**.
- Public Gallery identity is derived from `published_venue_version_id -> venue_versions.venue_id`, not from the current Draft authoring Gallery.
- Publishing a new Gallery Version does not automatically migrate Exhibitions.
- Different immutable Venue Versions can now switch in one browser session through the C25 Scene lifecycle controller.

Specific Gallery names are data. They are not platform/runtime branding.

## Canonical runtime path

Public Viewer resolves:

```text
Published Exhibition
  -> published_venue_version_id
  -> exact Venue / Gallery + Venue Version
  -> Venue Manifest / Venue Assets
  -> Space Definition
  -> Gallery_V0_11 createScene()
```

Admin authoring resolves the Exhibition's explicit Draft Venue Version. The engine receives `runtimeOptions.spaceDefinition`; it does not need Supabase table names, assignment SQL or model-validation SQL.

Canonical database model:

```text
venues
  -> venue_versions
     -> venue_assets

exhibitions
  -> exhibition_states
  -> exhibition_cards
```

No parallel Exhibition/Gallery assignment table is introduced. Legacy `gallery_exhibitions` / `gallery_state` are not normal runtime dependencies.

## Gallery Management baseline

C6C8C22 / C6C8C22.1 Gallery Management is PASS/CLOSED. Admin Workspace separates:

```text
EXHIBITIONS | GALLERIES
```

Gallery lifecycle remains:

```text
Create Gallery
-> initial Draft Version
-> building assets
-> Entry Point
-> Validate
-> Test Gallery
-> Publish immutable Version
-> Create/Open Next Draft
-> safe Rollback / Archive / Restore
```

A Gallery may have at most one active Draft Version. Next Draft creation is copy-on-write from current Published Version. Published/frozen Venue Versions are not edited in place.

## C6C8C23 Space Model Validation baseline

C23 is PASS/CLOSED and remains fully active in C25.

Required Gallery roles:

- `floor`
- `walls`
- `ceiling`

Optional:

- `props`

Missing Props cannot block Gallery validation, publication or Viewer startup. Assigned Props must pass the same technical validation as required models.

C23 validates GLB v2 structure, self-contained dependencies, buffers/bufferViews/accessors, scene/node/mesh/material/attribute references, reachable geometry, finite transforms/bounds, runtime mesh-name collisions and streamed SHA-256. Aggregate Draft validation blocks stale/failed immutable asset reports and cross-role runtime mesh-name collisions. It deliberately does not score art quality, polygon budgets, LOD or material aesthetics.

## C6C8C24 Exhibition ↔ Gallery Assignment

### Channel model

C24 allows the three exact Exhibition Venue Version channels to belong to different Galleries:

```text
Draft      -> authoring Gallery Version
Published  -> current public Gallery Version
Previous   -> rollback-history Gallery Version
```

The Draft authoring Gallery remains mirrored on `exhibitions.venue_id` and `exhibition_states.venue_id`. Published/Previous are exact Version references and are not forced to match that Draft Gallery.

### Draft-only reassignment

Normal Admin reassignment can target only the chosen Gallery's current Published/frozen Version.

Example:

```text
Before
Draft      -> Main Gallery v2
Published  -> Main Gallery v2

ASSIGN DRAFT -> Test Gallery v1
Draft      -> Test Gallery v1
Published  -> Main Gallery v2   (unchanged and still public)
```

Cross-Gallery reassignment resets only Gallery-specific spatial state: wall presentation state, artwork/sculpture placement/anchor/focus-camera fields, local lights, tour order and navigation path. Exhibition identity/media/text and unrelated non-spatial data remain.

A versioned `venueMigration` marker records the pending migration. If spatial items exist, the rebuilt layout must be saved after assignment before **CONFIRM LAYOUT**. An unresolved migration blocks Exhibition publication.

### Explicit publication boundary

**PUBLISH EXHIBITION** uses the canonical bundle publication RPC:

```text
Draft state/card/version       -> Published
old Published state/card/version -> Previous
```

Cross-Gallery Draft runtime saves stay private. Same-Version saves for an already Published Exhibition can retain the accepted instant state-publication path only when Draft Version still equals Published Version and no migration is pending.

Historical raw assignment and raw state-only publication functions are not browser-facing in C24.

### Public discovery

With no explicit `?exhibition=` query, the homepage requests canonical Published Exhibition cards **before** starting Babylon and renders them directly inside the homepage 3D stage. The legacy prestart `Enter gallery / About project` popup is not part of the current flow. Card Gallery name comes from the Published Venue Version and a missing cover uses a neutral fallback.

Choosing a card is the single visitor action: it starts loading/Babylon and enters that Exhibition immediately. Explicit deep links already identify the Exhibition and start directly. The `ADMIN` link is available before Gallery startup; `admin.html` owns direct authentication, while an authenticated already-live runtime can still use the C25 inline Admin fast path.

C25 replaces the former fresh-document cross-Gallery boundary with same-session Scene lifecycle switching. Same exact Venue Version keeps the accepted resident/delta Exhibition path; another exact Venue Version recreates the Scene on the same Engine/canvas.


## C6C8C25.3 Exhibition Publish / Optional Cover

- Poster/Cover is optional for Exhibition publication.
- Generic Exhibition Details save does not change public visibility.
- Publication is explicit through `PUBLISH EXHIBITION`; hiding is explicit through `UNPUBLISH EXHIBITION`.
- Admin shows canonical publication blockers/warnings from `admin_validate_exhibition()`.
- Public discovery supports coverless title-only cards.

## C6C8C25.2 Admin Gallery Partial Preview / UI Fixes

C25.2 adds a separate Gallery **authoring preview** policy without weakening normal Published/Public Space validation. Selecting a Gallery in Admin now drives the right-side Babylon viewport. A working Venue Version may be previewed with zero or partial building assets; only assigned assets are loaded.

Gallery authoring preview is deliberately isolated from real Exhibition content through a read-only synthetic Exhibition adapter. It cannot load/save the previously selected Exhibition's artwork, sculpture, lighting or editor state. Crossing between a normal Exhibition runtime and Gallery authoring preview forces a Scene lifecycle boundary even when the exact `venue_version_id` matches.

Returning `GALLERIES -> EXHIBITIONS` restores the selected Exhibition Draft runtime. Closing inline Admin from Gallery preview restores the remembered Published public runtime.

The strict publication contract is unchanged: Floor + Walls + Ceiling remain required and must pass C23 validation; Props remains optional. C25.2 also scopes Gallery Management text tokens to the dark Admin surface, hides normal runtime diagnostics from the standard Admin toolbar and constrains the in-scene editor panel to the actual 3D stage height.

## C6C8C25.1 Main-page Exhibition Entry / Admin Direct Access

C25.1 is a browser-flow correction over the C25 Scene lifecycle. It removes the obsolete double-entry path where visitors first saw `Enter gallery` and only then chose an Exhibition. Exhibition choice is now the entry gesture.

The loading/error BootGuard remains, but it is hidden during homepage prestart and appears only after an Exhibition has been chosen (or an explicit Exhibition deep link begins startup). Public `EXHIBITIONS` reopens the in-page selector without locking the whole document.

Admin access is independent from Babylon startup: the static `ADMIN` link can always open `admin.html`; only authenticated sessions with a live runtime intercept that link for the inline Admin fast path.

## C6C8C25 Cross-Space Runtime

C25 uses the exact immutable `venue_version_id` as the physical Space identity. Two Exhibitions may share one Gallery slug but still require a full Scene lifecycle if they target different Gallery Versions.

```text
same venue_version_id
  -> existing same-Scene Exhibition switch / residency

different venue_version_id
  -> resolve complete target runtime
  -> dispose old Scene
  -> create new Scene on the same Babylon Engine + canvas
  -> wait for lifecycle-matched Interaction Ready
```

The shared `scene-lifecycle-controller.js` owns the active Scene, lifecycle generation, cross-Version cutover and rollback. The Viewer and standalone Admin render loops read the mutable active Scene instead of closing over the first Scene.

Public/Admin runtime caches are mode-qualified so an Exhibition whose Published channel is Gallery A and Draft channel is Gallery B cannot reuse the wrong runtime. Per-Scene lifecycle IDs prevent stale asynchronous READY/FAIL events from completing a newer Scene.

Target runtime resolution happens before current Scene disposal. If target startup fails after disposal, C25 attempts to recreate the previous canonical runtime.

C25 does not change database schema/RPCs. It uses the deployed C24 assignment/publication contract.

## Test Gallery

`gallery-test.html?version=<venueVersionUuid>` loads one explicit Gallery Version through the authenticated test resolver. It does not resolve/load a real Exhibition state.

The engine exposes the small read-only bridge:

```text
GalleryApp.getCameraPose()
```

Gallery CRUD/versioning/model validation/Exhibition assignment remain outside `Gallery_V0_11.js`.

## Backend dependency

The application uses **Supabase** for Auth, Postgres/RLS/RPC data access and Storage.

Release SQL, migrations, prechecks/postchecks, rollback synchronizer and operator queries live under `OUTSIDE_REPO/SQL/` in the release package, not in the deployable repository.

## Compatibility identifiers

Some historical internal/debug aliases, localStorage keys, CSS/DOM identifiers and physical Storage names still contain `Berryboy`. They are retained only where changing them would risk accepted state/diagnostics/history and must not be used for new contracts.

## Validation

From repository root:

```bash
npm run check
```

This performs production build, syntax, repository verification and consolidated regression suites, including C23 executable GLB worker fixtures, C24 Exhibition/Gallery assignment invariants and C25 executable cross-space Scene lifecycle tests.

SQL package verification is separate:

```bash
node OUTSIDE_REPO/TOOLS/verify-sql-package.mjs
```

The SQL/package verifier is static. C25.2 has no SQL migration; production closure requires REPO deployment through GitHub / GitHub Pages and the C25.2 browser smoke.
